I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego under the supervision of <a href='https://fmeyer.ucsd.edu/'>Prof. Florian Meyer</a>. I have also been closely working with <a href='http://dsp.ucsd.edu/home/?page_id=4'>Prof. Bhaskar D. Rao</a>. Prior to joining UCSD, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018, and M.Sc. degree in ECE at UCSD in 2021. I was the receipt of <a href='https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2022-north-america'>Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship</a> in 2022.

My research focuses on machine learning and statistical signal processing. I am currently working on probabilistic modeling and machine learning algorithms on machine perception and sensing problems such as multi-object tracking and SLAM.
