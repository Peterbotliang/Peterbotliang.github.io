I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego under the supervision of <a href='https://fmeyer.ucsd.edu/'>Prof. Florian Meyer</a>. Prior joining UCSD, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018, and M.Sc. degree in ECE at UCSD in 2021. 

My research focuses on machine learning and statistical signal processing. I am currently working on probabilistic modeling and machine learning algorithms on machine perception and sensing problems such as multi-object tracking and SLAM.
